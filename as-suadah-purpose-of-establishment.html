        <p>Islam in the beginning established its foundation with knowledge, ethics and moral which is the major ingredient deployed by the prophet(S.A.W) to subject many converts. The knowledge in this context is not just knowledge about the religion but about virtually almost everything you could ever think of.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Our noble prophet upholds knowledge versatility in politics, business, agriculture, psychology, medicine, socialisation, and many more. Where are all these today?</p>
        <p>The noble prophet said: "seek for knowledge even if it can only be found in China". It has to be noted that during his days, the preaching of Islam has not extended or expanded to china and that definitely points that he was not reffering to the knowledge of Islam but rather any knowlegde that will benefit mankind race and well being.</p>
        <p>It is important so we can clarify our importance to ask ourselves, what exactly can the Muslims boast of among these unending technological innovations, industrial constructions, and other technical advancement that are trooping into the world economy?. Where are the Muslims?!</p>

        <h2>The dire need for skills </h2>
        <p>The world today is full of versatility and whoever wants to make the relevance lists of this generation has to be versatile. Versatility in this context means acquisition of many skills that are of greater need in today's world.</p>
        <p>Ironically, most of these skills are less attended to or can even be said to be absent in our educational institutions which means most of our graduates do not have it. Hence, the need to acquire it elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Some of these skills includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technical skills</li>
            <li>IT skills</li>
            <li>Cloud and distributed computing</li>
            <li>Analytical reasoning</li>
            <li>UI/UX design</li>
            <li>Web and Application development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Narrowing this phenomena issue to Islam and the muslims, we can say that we are less performing compared to other religion in helping our youths acquire these skills. As a result of this, we only find our people to be outfashioned and less relevant in most industries. The need to tackle this cannot be over-emphasized.</p>

        <h2>Why As-sua'dah Foundation ?</h2>
        <p>As-sua'dah Foundation is an organisation that emanate out of my desire to bring out the best of our Muslim youthsafter realising that we have short of Muslims in many relevant fields in our society. While establishing this organisation with some other youths, we hoped that we can set up a learning platform for these youths where they can acquire skilld and knowledge that are relevant in today's world.</p>

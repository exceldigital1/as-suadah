        <p>It is required of every Muslims to be of good intention and to be sincere with such intention. Also he mst do away with evil i.e bad intentions, showing off and hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>furthermoe, sincerity can be reffered to as the faithfulness of a servant in relating with the almighty Allah both in his intention and deeds.</p>
        <p>Allah (swt) says: Yet all that they had been commanded was that they serve Allah, with utter sicerity, devoting themselves exclusively to Him, and that they establish Prayer and pay Zakah, that is the right faith (Al-Bayyina vs 5).</p>

        <p>let us digress a little bit by telling a story that </p>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a king who was living a luzurious life with his only daughter in his loyal palace that is full of wonders</p>
        <p>The daughter of the king is so much loved by him. When the daughter attain maturity age and due for marriage, the king became worried and restless thinking of who he is going to marry off to and such man is going to succeed him.</p>
        <p>Then the king started looking out for a right suitor for his daughter that will be befitting, supportive and be of great comfort to his daughter.</p>
        <p>On a faithful night, the king called for one of his chiefs and sent him out to go around Mosques to look for a man who prioritize observing prayer at night and getting closer to God over sleeping to be a suitorfor his beloved daughter. The chief then set out to look for the young man as ordered by the king.</p>
        <p>On that night, a thief was trying to enter a mosque to take away what blongs to others when they are busy observing prayer. Suprisingly, the thief met the mosque closed and then he thought of an alternative of breaking through a cracked wall which he did. He then started to check out for valuables in the mosque.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the chief and the soldiers arrived and the thief heard their voices. One of the soldiers then matched into the mosques and the thief quickly changed position and tried to position himself as if he was praying.</p>
        <p>The soldier entered and saw this young man in a prayer mode. The chief saw him and exclaimed wow! This young man found his way to enter the mosque even when it is closed just because he does not want to miss prayer? the chief asked. He then asked the soldiers to bring out the young man when he finish praying.</p>
        <p>This young man couldn't his faked prayer ouut of fear that they might have knew about him wanting to come thief valuables in the mosque. The chief then became tired of waiting and ordered him to be brought forcefully at the end of the Rakah he is observing.</p>
        <p>The soldiers then took him to the king palace. When the king heard of his persistence on Ibadah, the long prayer he observed and other things found interesting about him, he became happy.</p>
        <p>Out of joy the king said commending him, "I have made findings about you being very religious and faithful to your God. So, i shall marry off my beloved daughter off to you and make you royal."</p>
        <p>This young man became overwhelmed and full of surprises and he couldn't believe what he was hearing. The king praised this man and he raised up his head and said: Oh lord! you make me royal and make me want to marry a king's daughter over a mere decietful prayer i was observing. Then what would ypu have rewarded me with if i was being a sincere servant of yours and if i was truly faithful to you. </p>
